This GitHub page serves as a collection of my learning projects and personal archives.  
Most repositories are created to document my progress in data science, statistics, and programming.

## Selected Repositories

- [DS_PreMaster_WeeklyPractice](https://github.com/NUSSETO/DS_PreMaster_WeeklyPractice)  
  Weekly practice projects for data science fundamentals.  
 
- [History_Code_Archive](https://github.com/NUSSETO/History_Code_Archive)  
  Archived code from earlier learning stages, including coursework and problem solving.

## Notes

- Repositories reflect different stages of my learning journey.
- Most of the code is written for learning purposes and isn't production-ready.
- Many projects include READMEs or notes to track what I’ve learned.
